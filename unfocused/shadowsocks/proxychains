1. proxychains can be used in conjection with a regular command to enable the command to acess the Internet vis SS.
2. Install proxychains.
3. Configure the /etc/proxychains4.conf file.
4. set and only set "socks5 127.0.0.1 1080"
5. Use "proxychains4 cmd" to launch the command.

6. If proxychain4 is not working (we can check this by "proxychains4 curl https://www.google.com"), stop polipo
   with "sudo /etc/init.d/polipo stop", and then restart polipo with "sudo /etc/init.d/polipo restart"
   
7. We must first turn off the proxy from Ubuntu setting, then we can create a terminal and use proxychains4 in that terminal.
   Otherwise proxychains4 can't work correctly.
